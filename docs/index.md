## Why COON?

When working with Large Language Models for code generation, token efficiency directly impacts cost and context utilization:

- **Context Windows**: LLMs have finite context windows that fill quickly with verbose code
- **API Costs**: Token count directly correlates with API pricing
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Agents passing code between each other multiply token overhead
- **Response Quality**: More context space for examples improves generation quality

## Quick Example

**Standard Dart code** (verbose):

```dart
class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Login")),
      body: Center(child: Text("Welcome")),
    );
  }
}
```

**COON format** (65% fewer tokens):

```
c:LoginScreen<StatelessWidget>;m:b S{a:B{t:T"Login"},b:N{c:T"Welcome"}}
```

## Installation

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coon/sdk
```

```bash [pip]
pip install coon
```

```bash [npx (no install)]
npx @coon/cli compress app.dart
```

## Token Savings

| Test Case | Original | Compressed | Reduction |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Simple Widget | 33 tokens | 13 tokens | 60.6% |
| Login Screen | 405 tokens | 121 tokens | 70.1% |
| List View | 165 tokens | 78 tokens | 52.7% |
| **Average** | - | - | **61.3%** |
