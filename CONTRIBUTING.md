   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following these guidelines:
   - Keep code simple and readable
   - Add comments where needed
   - Follow existing code style
   - Update documentation if needed

3. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear description of changes"
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

#### Pull Request Guidelines

Your pull request should:

- Have a clear title and description
- Reference related issues
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation if needed
- Pass all existing tests

## Modifying Abbreviations

**Important**: NEVER hardcode abbreviations in source files. Always edit the canonical spec/data sources.

### Adding or Updating Abbreviations

1. **Edit the canonical source files**:
   - For Dart/Flutter: Edit files in `spec/languages/dart/`
     - `widgets.json` - Widget class abbreviations
     - `keywords.json` - Language keyword abbreviations
     - `properties.json` - Property name abbreviations
   - For JavaScript/React: Edit files in `spec/languages/javascript/`
     - `components.json` - React hooks and JSX elements
     - `keywords.json` - JavaScript keyword abbreviations
     - `properties.json` - JSX prop abbreviations

2. **Regenerate browser-compatible file** (JavaScript SDK only):
   ```bash
   cd packages/javascript
   npm run generate:browser
   ```
   This updates `src/browser.ts` from the spec sources.

3. **Run conformance tests** to ensure consistency:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_conformance.py
   ```

4. **Commit both the spec changes AND generated files**:
   ```bash
   git add spec/languages/
   git add packages/javascript/src/browser.ts  # If JavaScript SDK affected
   git commit -m "feat: Add abbreviation for NewWidget"
   ```

### Why This Matters

The abbreviation data in `spec/languages/` is the **Single Source of Truth**. This ensures:
- Both Python and JavaScript SDKs stay synchronized
- Browser-compatible builds don't drift from Node.js versions
- Conformance tests validate consistency across implementations

## Code Style

### Python Code

- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions short and focused
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

Example:
```python
def compress_code(code: str) -> str:
    """
    Compress the given code.
    
    Args:
        code: Source code to compress
        
    Returns:
        Compressed code string
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation

- Write clear, simple sentences
- Use examples where helpful
- Keep explanations brief
- Update README.md if adding features

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Run specific test:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_compressor.py
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features:

1. Add tests in the `tests/` directory
2. Test both success and failure cases
3. Keep tests simple and focused

Example:
```python
def test_compression():
    code = "class Test {}"
    result = compress_dart(code)
    assert len(result) < len(code)
```

## Documentation

### Updating Documentation

If your changes affect usage:

1. Update README.md
2. Update relevant docs in `docs/`
3. Add examples if helpful
